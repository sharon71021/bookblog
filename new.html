David Yoon’s haunting new novel opens with a man lying supine in a desert, clueless as to what happened to him and where he is. The world has ended. The apocalypse has happened. As pieces of his memory slowly return, it becomes evident that he had a wife and daughter who are now lost forever. As the man figures out how to survive in this new barren land, he transitions from isolation to fear to, finally, acceptance. City of Orange is Yoon’s second book for adults, following Version Zero; he’s also written the young-adult novels Frankly in Love and Super Fake Love Song. Yoon manages to imbue these small activities with dramatic tension that works in two very different ways. First, there is the horror in recognizing looming existential threats: death, if he can’t find water and food, but also the nearly unimaginable fact that everything he loves and knows is gone and never, ever coming back. Second, and rather unexpectedly, the sequences are sprinkled with gallows humor. When he finds a wine opener and tries to use it to open the faucet, he thinks about how “Thousands of years from now, his preserved skeleton will be on display in a museum suspended by invisible force fields. They’ll totally have force fields by then. In his bony hand will rest a primitive artifact of unclear purpose.”</h3>
